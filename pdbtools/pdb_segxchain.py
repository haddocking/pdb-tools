"""
Swaps the chain identifier by the segment identifier.

If the segment identifier is longer than one character, the script will
truncate it. Does not ensure unique chain IDs.

Usage:
    python pdb_segxchain.py <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_segxchain.py 1CTF.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
