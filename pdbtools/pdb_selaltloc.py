Selects altloc labels for the entire PDB file.

By default, selects the label with the highest occupancy value for each atom,
but the user can define a specific altloc label to select.

Selecting by highest occupancy removes all altloc labels for all atoms. If the
user provides an option (e.g. -A), only atoms with conformers with an altloc A
are processed by the script. If you select -A and an atom has conformers with
altlocs B and C, both B and C will be kept in the output.

Despite not an official format, many times alternative locations are identified
by a blank character ' ' (space), and a character, for example ('A'). In these
cases, to select the alternative location identified by a blank character,
define blank in the command line, see below.

Usage:
    python pdb_selaltloc.py [-<option>] <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_selaltloc.py 1CTF.pdb  # picks locations with highest occupancy
    python pdb_selaltloc.py -A 1CTF.pdb  # picks alternate locations labelled 'A'
    python pdb_selaltloc.py -' ' 1CTF.pdb  # picks alternate locations labelled blank ' '

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.

    Selects altloc labels for the entire PDB file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fhandle : an iterable giving the PDB file line-by-line.

    option : str or `None`.
        The alternative location identifier to select. By default
        (`None`) selects the alternative location with highest
        occupancy. In this case, if the different alternative locations
        have the same occupancy, selects the one that comes first.
        Selecting by highest occupancy removes all altloc labels for all
        atoms. Provide an option (e.g. 'A') to select only atoms with
        altloc label `A`. If you select `A` and an atom has conformers
        with altlocs `B` and `C`, both B and C will be kept in the
        output. Despite not an official format, many times alternative
        locations are identified by a blank character ' ' (space), and a
        [A-Z] character.  In these cases, to select the alternative
        location identified by a blank character give `option=' '`.

    Returns
    -------
    generator
        A generator object. To exhaust the generator, that is, to
        process the PDB file (or PDB lines), convert it to a list.
