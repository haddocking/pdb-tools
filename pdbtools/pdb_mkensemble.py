"""
Merges several PDB files into one multi-model (ensemble) file.

Strips all HEADER information and adds REMARK statements with the provenance
of each conformer.

Usage:
    python pdb_mkensemble.py <pdb file> <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_mkensemble.py 1ABC.pdb 1XYZ.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
