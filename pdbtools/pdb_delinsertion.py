Deletes insertion codes in a PDB file.

Deleting an insertion code shifts the residue numbering of downstream
residues. Allows for picking specific residues to delete insertion codes for.

Usage:
    python pdb_delinsertion.py [-<option>] <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_delinsertion.py 1CTF.pdb  # delete ALL insertion codes
    python pdb_delinsertion.py -A9,B12 1CTF.pdb  # deletes ins. codes for res
                                                 # 9 of chain A and 12 of chain B.

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
