"""
Renames chain identifiers sequentially, based on TER records.

Since HETATM records are not separated by TER records and usually come together
at the end of the PDB file, this script will attempt to reassign their chain
identifiers based on the changes it made to ATOM lines. This might lead to bad
output in certain corner cases.

Usage:
    python pdb_chainbows.py <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_chainbows.py 1CTF.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
