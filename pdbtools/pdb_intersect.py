"""
Returns a new PDB file only with atoms in common to all input PDB files.

Atoms are judged equal is their name, altloc, res. name, res. num, insertion
code and chain fields are the same. Coordinates are taken from the first input
file. Keeps matching TER/ANISOU records.

Usage:
    python pdb_intersect.py <pdb file> <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_intersect.py 1XYZ.pdb 1ABC.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
