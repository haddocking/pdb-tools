"""
Merges several PDB files into one.

Use `pdb_mkensemble` if you with to make an ensemble of multiple
conformation states of the same protein.

Follows the criteria:

    * The merged PDB file will represent a single MODEL.
    * Non-coordinate lines in input PDBs will be ignored.
    * Atom numbers are restarted from 1.
    * CONECT lines are yield at the end. CONECT numbers are updated to
        the new atom numbers.
    * Missing TER and END statements are placed accordingly. Original
        TER and END statements are maintained.

Usage:
    python pdb_merge.py <pdb file> <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_merge.py 1ABC.pdb 1XYZ.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
