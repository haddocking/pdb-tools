Selects residues according to the B-factor values.

Valid Operations:
    [g] - greater than
    [l] - less than
    [e] - equal to
    [n] - not equal to

Valid B-Factor Filtering Modes:
    [mean] - Filter by the mean of the B-factors of all atoms in a residue
    [min] - Filter by the atom with the minimum B-factor in a residue
    [max] - Filter by the atom with the maximum B-factor in a residue

Usage:
    python pdb_selb.py -<filtering_mode>:<operators> -treshold  <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_selb.py -mean:g -10  1CTF.pdb  # selects residues with a mean B-factor greater than 10
    python pdb_selb.py -min:g -10  1CTF.pdb  # selects residues where the atom with the minimum B-factor has a B-factor greater than 10
    python pdb_selb.py -max:g -10  1CTF.pdb  # selects residues where the atom with the maximum B-factor has a B-factor greater than 10

    python pdb_selb.py -mean:l -10 1CTF.pdb # selects residues with a mean B-factor less than 10
    python pdb_selb.py -min:ge -10 1CTF.pdb # selects residues where the atom with the minimum B-factor has a B-factor greater than or equal to 10
    python pdb_selb.py -max:le -10 1CTF.pdb # selects residues where the atom with the maximum B-factor has a B-factor less than or equal to 10
    python pdb_selb.py -mean:e -10 1CTF.pdb # selects residues with a mean B-factor equal to 10
    python pdb_selb.py -mean:n -10 1CTF.pdb # selects residues with a mean B-factor not equal to 10

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.

    This function is a generator.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fhandle : a line-by-line iterator of the original PDB file.

    filtering_mode: string
        The desired filtering mode that should be used to select in which
        conditions a residue should be filtered.
        Filtering mode values:
            "mean": Filter by the mean of the B-factors of all atoms in a residue
            "min": Filter by the atom with the minimum B-factor in a residue
            "max": Filter by the atom with the maximum B-factor in a residue


    operator : string
        The desired operator that should be used to filter by bafctor. The
        combination of multiple operator values such as "ge" can also be used.
        Operator values:
            "g": greater than operator
            "l": less than operator
            "e": equal to operator
            "n": not equal to operator

    operator_treshold : float
        The treshold bfactor value that should be used to filter by bfactor.

    ------
    str (line-by-line)
        The modified (or not) PDB line.
