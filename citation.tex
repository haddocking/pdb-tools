  abstract = {The pdb-tools are a collection of Python scripts for working with molecular structure data in the PDB format. They allow users to edit, convert, and validate PDB files, from the command-line, in a simple but efficient manner. The pdb-tools are implemented in Python, without any external dependencies, and are freely available under the open-source Apache License at https://github.com/haddocking/pdb-tools/ and on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pdb-tools/).},
