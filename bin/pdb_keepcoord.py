"""
Removes all non-coordinate records from the file.
Keeps only MODEL, ENDMDL, END, ATOM, HETATM, and CONECT.

Usage:
    python pdb_keepcoord.py <pdb file>

Example:
    python pdb_keepcoord.py 1CTF.pdb

This program is part of the `pdb-tools` suite of utilities and should not be
distributed isolatedly. The `pdb-tools` were created to quickly manipulate PDB
files using the terminal, and can be used sequentially, with one tool streaming
data to another. They are based on old FORTRAN77 code that was taking too much
effort to maintain and compile. RIP.
